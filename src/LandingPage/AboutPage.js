                <p>
                My name is Divya R Bondre, and I am a full-stack developer specializing in Mobile Development and iOS
                Development, with a strong interest in front-end web technologies.
                On the web development side, I've created interactive and responsive websites using HTML and CSS, as
                well as JavaScript frameworks like React.js. These projects reflect my attention to detail and
                commitment to creating beautiful, functional user interfaces.
                I am passionate about building innovative solutions to real-world problems and constantly exploringnew
                tools and frameworks to elevate my development skills. Whether it's designing a sleek front end or
                architecting a scalable back end, I enjoy crafting software that makes a difference.
